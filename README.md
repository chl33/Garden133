# Garden133

Solar-powered board for measuring garden soil moisture level.

This is the KiCAD design and firmware for the Garden133 sensor board.
It is part of a system for monitoring the moisture level of soil in your yard or garden.
It reads the moisture level of soil using a capacitive moisture sensor.
It is powered by battery and solar power.
It communicates sensor values via LoRa.

The sensor board integrates with Home Assistant via a base station.
The base station project is [LoRa133](https://github.com/chl33/LoRa133).

Please see the [Introducing Garden133](https://selectiveappeal.org/posts/garden133/) blog post
for a project overview.
